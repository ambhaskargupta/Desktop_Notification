# Desktop_Notification
Desktop Notification
This is a Desktop Notification Application coded in Python on Jupyter Notebook.
It is basically a Desktop Notification program to give a alert remainder as a Notification.
It is developed using Tkinter Module.
It has a Database name 'capstone' containing a table named 'notification' to store the Notification Details.
It has two files running simultaneously.
First one to have a GUI interface and second one to run in background to have a connection with the database and display the Notification.

Thank You.
